## About me

I'll address the elephant in the room...yes, that is a live look at me coding above. Now that that is out of the way, I'm a software engineer who is passionate about fitness and health and their relation to technology, creating technology that makes a difference in others lives, and building community. Some technologies I enjoy working with are ReactJS, React-Native, JavaScript, APIs, and always pushing myself to learn more!
