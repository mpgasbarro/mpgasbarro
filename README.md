## A Little Bit About me

I'll address the elephant in the room...yes, that is a live look at me coding above. Now that you're thoroughly impressed with my 7 WPM, I'm a software engineer who is passionate about creating technology that makes a difference in others lives and being apart of something bigger than myself! I also have a passion for fitness/health and their relation to technology. Some technologies I enjoy working with are ReactJS, React-Native, JavaScript, Python, APIs, and always pushing myself to learn more!
