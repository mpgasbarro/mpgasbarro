## A Little Bit About me

I'll address the elephant in the room...yes, that is a live look at me coding above. Now that you're thoroughly impressed with my 7 WPM, I'm a software engineer who is passionate about fitness/health and their relation to technology and creating technology that makes a difference in others lives. Some technologies I enjoy working with are ReactJS, React-Native, JavaScript, Python APIs, and always pushing myself to learn more!
